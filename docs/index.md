## Creating Synesthesia Scenes

Synesthesia is a performance tool that allows you to perform real-time visuals that are also audio reactive and incorporate media. We call these *Scenes*, and under the hood they are GLSL fragment shaders that create visuals with code. If you're looking to create your own Scenes, you can start with the documentation for the [Synesthesia Shader Format (SSF)](ssf/ssf.md). Be sure to check out the page on [SSF audio uniforms](ssf/audio_uniforms.md), which allow you to easily create audio reactive visuals.

You can also dive right in with the ["Getting Started" tutorial](./tutorials/first_scene.md), which will walk through creating your first scene.

To learn more about GLSL and fragment shaders, check out the [GLSL Resources page](./resources/glsl_resources.md).
