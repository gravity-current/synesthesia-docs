# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [Synesthesia](https://www.synesthesia.live/), an audio-reactive visual instrument used by VJs, musicians, and creative coders worldwide. 

If you haven't yet downloaded Synesthesia, that's a good place to start ([Mac](https://production.synesthesia.live/mac/try)/[Windows](https://production.synesthesia.live/windows/try)).

## Creating Synesthesia Scenes

Synesthesia is primarily a tool to run and perform with *scenes*, which are essentially GLSL fragment shaders that create visuals with code. If you're looking to create your own scenes, you can start with the documentation for the [Synesthesia Shader Format (SSF)](ssf/ssf.md). Be sure to check out the page on [SSF audio uniforms](ssf/audio_uniforms.md), which allow you to easily create audio reactive visuals.

You can also dive right in with the ["Getting Started" tutorial](./tutorials/first_scene.md), which will walk through creating your first scene.

To learn more about GLSL and fragment shaders, check out the [GLSL Resources page](./resources/glsl_resources.md).
