# SSF Standard Uniforms

When a scene is compiled, Synesthesia adds a host of uniform values that make scene writing easier and more powerful. 

## Basic Uniforms

Versions of these uniforms are commonly included in all GLSL environments.

Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`vec2 RENDERSIZE` | The width and height in pixels of the *current pass* ([learn more about passes](./json.md#passes))
`float TIME` | The time in seconds since the scene started rendering.
`float FRAMECOUNT` | The number of frames since the scene started rendering.
`vec2 _xy` | The current position of the pixel. Equivalent to `gl_FragCoord.xy`.
`vec2 _uv` | The current *normalized* position of the pixel, with components in the range `0.0` to `1.0`. Equivalent to `gl_FragCoord.xy / RENDERSIZE`.
`vec2 _uvc` | The current normalized position of the pixel *with aspect ratio correction*, such that `(0,0)` will be in the center of the screen. A circle drawn with these coordinates will not appear stretched.
`const float PI` | `3.14159...`

## Mouse Uniforms

These uniforms track mouse movement and action within the preview window. This allows more intuitive and complex interaction with scenes like camera control, drawing, or color picking.

Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`vec4 _mouse` | Emulates the `iMouse` uniform available in [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/). It stores x, y, x of previous click, and y of previous click. The previous x and y values are negative if the mouse is not down. These positions are not normalized â€” they are integer pixel values. Learn more about `iMouse` [here](https://shadertoyunofficial.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/special-shadertoy-features/)
`vec3 _click` | The state of mouse buttons in the order: left, right, middle. Each component will be `1` when that button is pressed and `0` when it is not
`vec2 _muv` | The normalized coordinates of the mouse within the preview window (`0`-`1`)
`vec2 _muvc` | The mouse's normalized coordinates with aspect ratio correction, so they can be used to draw circles (like `_uvc`)

## Multipass Uniforms

Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`int PASSINDEX` | The index of the current pass. If your shader is a one-pass shader (the default), this will always be zero. It starts at 0 and increments by one for each pass of the shader.
`sampler2D syn_FinalPass` | The previous frame rendered by the shader. Useful for creating simple visual feedback effects.


## Media Uniforms
Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`sampler2D syn_UserImage` | The texture of the current media selected in the media section of the control panel. **NOTE:** to load this texture into your scene, you should use the [`loadUserImage()` function](functions.md#_loaduserimage) or [`textureUserImage()` function](functions.md#_textureuserimage)
`float syn_MediaType` | Indicates the type of the current media: `None = 0`, `Image = 1`, `Video = 2`, `Webcam = 3`. You can check if media is loaded with `syn_MediaType > 0.5`.
