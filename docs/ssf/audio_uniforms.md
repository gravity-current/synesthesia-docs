# SSF Audio Uniforms

Synesthesia analyzes whatever music is playing in real-time, providing a large set of audio reactive uniforms. These uniforms are automatically updated every frame, making it easy to create reactive visuals without performing any of your own audio analysis.

Many of the uniforms rely on [FFT analysis](https://www.dataq.com/data-acquisition/general-education-tutorials/fft-fast-fourier-transform-waveform-analysis.html), splitting the audio spectrum into 4 main bands: Bass, Mid, MidHigh, and High. 

### Level
These uniforms track the level (loudness) of specific frequency bands, with some added smoothing to reduce jitter. They are normalized to the range `0.0` to `1.0`.

- `syn_Level` *(whole spectrum)*
- `syn_BassLevel`
- `syn_MidLevel`
- `syn_MidHighLevel`
- `syn_HighLevel`
<!-- - **SPECIAL**: `syn_RawLevel` *(the )* -->

### Hits
These uniforms detect 'hits' within specific frequency bands, spiking in value during the isolated transients. Great for tracking drum hits or percussive action. They are normalized to the range `0.0` to `1.0`.

- `syn_Hits` *(whole spectrum)*
- `syn_BassHits`
- `syn_MidHits`
- `syn_MidHighHits`
- `syn_HighHits`

### Time
These uniforms are clocks that move forward when the volume of a specific frequency band is high. Use these uniforms to make a scene move more when the music picks up, or to create pulsing movement (like a camera that moves forward on each kick). Note that these *do not* normalize between `0` and `1` and are similar scale to the `TIME` uniform.

- `syn_Time` *(whole spectrum)*
- `syn_BassTime`
- `syn_MidTime`
- `syn_MidHighTime`
- `syn_HighTime`
- **SPECIAL**: `syn_CurvedTime` *(similar to* `syn_Time`, *but responds to volume increases with much higher acceleration)*
    
### Presence
These uniforms track the 'presence' of specific frequency bands, detecting rising or falling action without reacting to each individual sound. For example, `syn_BassPresence` will be high when "there is a significant bass presence in the song right now."

- `syn_Presence` *(whole spectrum)*
- `syn_BassPresence`
- `syn_MidPresence`
- `syn_MidHighPresence`
- `syn_HighPresence`

### Beat
These uniforms use beat detection to change a variety of variables on beat.

Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`syn_OnBeat` | Returns `1.0` immediately when a beat is detected, then quickly falls back to zero.
`syn_ToggleOnBeat` | Returns `0.0` until a beat is detected, then stays at `1.0` until another beat is detected, then toggles back to `0.0`, etc. Smoothly transitions between values using a logistic curve.
`syn_RandomOnBeat` | Returns a new random float in the range `0.0` to `1.0` whenever a beat is detected. Smoothly transitions using a logistic curve.
`syn_BeatTime` | A clock that increments by `1.0` whenever a beat is detected.
   
### BPM
These uniforms are separate from the preceding beat detection uniforms and give different results, as they are based on a continuous analysis of the song's BPM. Good for detecting a groove and moving with it consistently.

Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`syn_BPM` | The actual BPM, ranging from `50` to `220`.
`syn_BPMConfidence` | Estimates the stability of the BPM in the current song. If the song is very consistent, this will be close to `1.0`. If the BPM is shifting frequently, it will stay close to `0.0`.
`syn_BPMTwitcher` | A clock that increments every beat. In contrast to `syn_BeatTime`, it exponentially "jumps" in value to the next beat, allowing smoother action in the scene. To get *just* a clock like `syn_BeatTime`, use `floor(syn_BPMTwitcher)`. To get *just* the jittery action on each beat, use `fract(syn_BPMTwitcher)`. 
`syn_BPMSin` | A sine wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to the current BPM and a phase that is usually synced to the beat.
`syn_BPMSin2` | A sine wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to **HALF** of the current BPM for slower action.
`syn_BPMSin4` | A sine wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to **ONE QUARTER** of the current BPM for slower action.
`syn_BPMTri` | A triangle wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to the current BPM and a phase that is usually synced to the beat.
`syn_BPMTri2` | A triangle wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to **HALF** of the current BPM for slower action.
`syn_BPMTri4` | A triangle wave that oscillates between `0.0` and `1.0`, with a frequency equal to **ONE QUARTER** of the current BPM for even slower action.


        
### Large Features
Uniform | Description
------------ | -------------
`syn_FadeInOut` | Slowly rises to `1.0` as music starts, then slowly falls to `0.0` as the music ends. Great for fading in and out of a scene like a movie would.
`syn_Intensity` | Similar to `syn_FadeInOut`, but slowly accumulates to `1.0` depending on the intensity of the song.
