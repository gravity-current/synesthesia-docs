# How to Manually Convert from Shadertoy.com to SSF

**Note**: Always respect the license of the original artist when porting work from Shadertoy to Synesthesia.

This video covers how to manually convert from Shadertoy.com to the Synesthesia Shader Format. This is useful when a Shader isn't working via the auto converter for one reason or another. Some scenes are simpler than others, and we had a pretty easy one here. Every scene will have its own series of steps you'll have to take to port it, but this lays out the basic steps that are the same for all scenes, and then talks through some of the more tricky "gotchas" that can pop up.
